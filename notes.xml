ansible
--------
what is ansible?
1.ansible is a configuration management tool... 
2.Ansible is a simple, powerful, cross-platform, and agentless IT automation tool that everyone can use for their needs.
what is configuration management tool?
	it is maintain number(100 and 1000's) of machines with automation

what it maintain ?
	it maintain the system resources such as
    1)install a application
	2)configuration
	3)updates
	4)maintain and so on..

why configuration management tool?
	->reduce management complexity
	->save time

infrastructure as a code:
------------------------
- with the code we can manage the infrastructure
	
configuration management tools(CM):
1.There are two types of CM
   1.Pull based CM
   2.Push Based CM

2.Direction of communication
  PULL => Node to CM server
  Push => CM Server to Node
What is required in PULL Based CM:
----------------------------------
Agent needs to be installed with necessary credentials to connect to CM Server
What is required in Push Based CM:
----------------------------------
 1.List of nodes (inventory)
 2.Credentials to login into node

	puppet ----> 2005	pull
	chef ------->2008	pull
	ansible ----->2011	push

how ansible work?
	ansible is working based on push mechanisam. push based means here server(master) will push the code into the nodes(slaves).

how the master communicate with slaves?
	with ssh public key & private key they communicate.

- we can work with ansible in 2 ways
 i)playbooks (all tasks place in one .yml file and run it)
 ii)ad-hoc (on the command line we perform this)


ansible playbooks:
------------------
Q)what is playbook?
    1.the collection of play 
	2.playbook is a set of instructions file. to do a particular tasks on target(host) or group of target(hosts).

Q)how playbook works?
	playbook works with modules(yum,service,file,etc..), and inventory file(/etc/ansible/hosts) over ssh communication.

Q)what we need to run playbook ?
	we need to specify target, tasks in playbook with modules(apt oryum, file, etc..)

ansible role:
------------
 1.place the group of playbooks in one file. it will help reduce the code complexity, and increase the code reusability.
 2.There's a large playbook file with hundreds lines of code. It's frustrating to maintain, change, and support it. We must cut this huge file into smaller files and use a single master playbook to control these files using - include <playbook name> in the master playbook

Control Node:
-------------
 where we have Machine with Ansible installed
Managed Node: 
-------------
Machines that you manage with Ansible
Inventory:
-----------
 List of managed nodes, default file location is /etc/ansible/hosts
Modules:
--------- 
Unit of code that Ansible executes
Tasks: 
-------
Unit of action in Ansible
Playbooks: 
-----------
we have to excute Ordered list of tasks
